## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (Python package manager)
- Google API key for Gemini AI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd data_extractor
```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Google API key:
```bash
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Google API key. You can obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### Starting the Application

1. Activate the Poetry environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py

```
You should see the DataExtractPro homepage with:
